# Security Considerations

When working with APIs that require authentication, it's important to follow security best practices to protect sensitive credentials and data.

## Credential Management

### Environment Variables

Store API keys and tokens as environment variables rather than hardcoding them in your configuration files:

```yaml
auth:
  type: api_key
  header: X-API-Key
  key: ${MY_API_KEY}
```

In your Python code, you can set environment variables before running your script:

```python
import os
os.environ["MY_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key_here"  # Set this securely
```

### Secure Storage

For production environments, consider using:

- Environment variables set at the system or container level
- Secret management services like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
- Encrypted configuration files with restricted access

## Authentication Methods

ApiLinker supports several authentication methods, each with its own security considerations:

### API Key Authentication

```yaml
auth:
  type: api_key
  header: X-API-Key  # Header name varies by API
  key: ${API_KEY}
```

**Security tips:**
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use keys with the minimum required permissions
- Set IP restrictions on API keys when supported by the service

### Bearer Token Authentication

```yaml
auth:
  type: bearer
  token: ${BEARER_TOKEN}
```

**Security tips:**
- Use short-lived tokens when possible
- Implement token refresh logic for long-running processes
- Store refresh tokens with additional security measures

### Basic Authentication

```yaml
auth:
  type: basic
  username: ${API_USERNAME}
  password: ${API_PASSWORD}
```

**Security tips:**
- Only use over HTTPS connections
- Use application-specific passwords when available
- Avoid using your main account credentials

### OAuth 2.0

```yaml
auth:
  type: oauth2
  client_id: ${CLIENT_ID}
  client_secret: ${CLIENT_SECRET}
  token_url: "https://api.example.com/oauth/token"
  scope: "read write"
```

**Security tips:**
- Store client secrets securely
- Request only the scopes you need
- Implement proper token storage and refresh logic

## Network Security

### HTTPS Enforcement

ApiLinker enforces HTTPS for all production API endpoints by default. To override this (not recommended except for development):

```yaml
source:
  enforce_https: false  # Not recommended for production
```

### Request Timeouts

Set appropriate timeouts to prevent hanging connections:

```yaml
source:
  timeout: 30  # Timeout in seconds
```

## Rate Limiting

Configure rate limits to prevent accidental API abuse:

```yaml
source:
  rate_limit:
    requests_per_second: 5
    burst: 10
```

## Audit Logging

Enable audit logging for security-relevant events:

```yaml
logging:
  level: INFO
  security_audit: true
  file: "apilinker_audit.log"
```

## Data Handling

### Sensitive Data Filtering

When logging API responses, sensitive data can be filtered:

```yaml
logging:
  filter_fields:
    - "password"
    - "token"
    - "secret"
    - "credit_card"
```

### Data Validation

Always validate data before processing:

```yaml
mapping:
  - source: "get_user"
    target: "create_profile"
    validation:
      required_fields: ["id", "email"]
      email_fields: ["email"]
```

## Best Practices for Custom Plugins

When developing custom plugins:

1. Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks
2. Do not log sensitive information
3. Handle exceptions properly to avoid information leakage
4. Follow the principle of least privilege when accessing resources

## Security Configuration Example

A complete security-focused configuration might look like:

```yaml
source:
  type: rest
  base_url: "https://api.example.com"
  auth:
    type: oauth2
    client_id: ${CLIENT_ID}
    client_secret: ${CLIENT_SECRET}
    token_url: "https://api.example.com/oauth/token"
    scope: "read"
  timeout: 30
  rate_limit:
    requests_per_second: 10
  retry:
    max_attempts: 3
    backoff_factor: 2

logging:
  level: INFO
  security_audit: true
  filter_fields:
    - "password"
    - "token"
    - "secret"
```

Remember that security is an ongoing process. Regularly review and update your security practices, and stay informed about security updates for ApiLinker and its dependencies.
