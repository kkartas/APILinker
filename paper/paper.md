# Summary

Modern software systems frequently rely on data exchange between specialized services, each with their own REST APIs. While individual API clients are common, developers often need to build custom integration code to connect different services. ApiLinker addresses this challenge by providing a universal bridge between any two REST APIs, enabling data mapping, transformation, and scheduled synchronization with minimal configuration. This open-source Python package simplifies the creation of reliable API integrations for both one-time data migrations and ongoing synchronization workflows.

# Statement of Need

The growth of microservices and SaaS products has created an ecosystem of specialized APIs that need to communicate with each other [@Fowler2014]. Currently, developers must choose between expensive commercial integration platforms, limited point-to-point connectors, or building custom integration code. Each approach has significant drawbacks in terms of cost, maintenance burden, flexibility, or development time.

Researchers and data scientists face similar challenges when collecting data from multiple REST APIs for analysis, often writing repetitive code for authentication, pagination, and data normalization [@Verborgh2013]. These integration challenges exist across domains including bioinformatics [@Ison2013], climate science [@Vitolo2015], and social media analytics [@Lomborg2014], where connecting disparate APIs is essential for comprehensive data collection.

ApiLinker addresses these needs by providing:

1. A configuration-driven approach that eliminates repetitive boilerplate code
2. Flexible field mapping with support for nested structures and data transformations
3. Multiple authentication methods (API Key, Bearer Token, Basic Auth, OAuth2)
4. Built-in pagination handling, retry logic, and error management
5. Scheduling capabilities for recurring data synchronization
6. An extensible plugin architecture for custom connectors and transformations

By reducing integration complexity to a declarative configuration, ApiLinker enables developers, researchers and data scientists to focus on their domain-specific problems rather than the mechanics of API integration.

# Core Features

ApiLinker is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns into logical components:

## API Connectors

The connector module handles communication with REST APIs, supporting various HTTP methods, customizable endpoints, and automatic pagination. Each endpoint is configured with its path, method, headers, and optional parameters.

```python
connector = ApiConnector(
    connector_type="rest",
    base_url="https://api.example.com/v1",
    auth_config=auth_config,
    endpoints={
        "list_users": {
            "path": "/users",
            "method": "GET",
            "pagination": {"data_path": "data", "next_page_path": "meta.next"}
        }
    }
)
```

## Field Mapping

The mapper module translates data structures between source and target formats using a flexible mapping system. It supports nested field paths, conditional mappings, and data transformations.

```python
mapper.add_mapping(
    source="list_users",
    target="create_user",
    fields=[
        {"source": "id", "target": "external_id"},
        {"source": "profile.name", "target": "full_name", "transform": "strip"}
    ]
)
```

## Authentication

Multiple authentication methods are supported, with secure environment variable handling:

```yaml
auth:
  type: oauth2_client_credentials
  client_id: ${CLIENT_ID}
  client_secret: ${CLIENT_SECRET}
  token_url: https://auth.example.com/token
  scope: read write
```

## Scheduling

The scheduler component enables recurring synchronizations with interval or cron-based timing:

```python
scheduler.add_schedule(type="cron", expression="0 */6 * * *")  # Every 6 hours
scheduler.start(sync_function)
```

# Implementation and Architecture

ApiLinker is implemented in Python (3.8+) with minimal dependencies. The architecture follows object-oriented design principles with clear separation of concerns:

- `ApiConnector`: Handles HTTP communication, retries, and pagination
- `FieldMapper`: Manages data transformation between source and target formats
- `AuthManager`: Configures and refreshes authentication credentials
- `Scheduler`: Handles timing for recurring synchronization tasks
- `PluginManager`: Loads custom extensions for specialized use cases

The package is designed for both programmatic use as a library and as a command-line tool. Configuration can be defined in YAML/JSON or constructed programmatically in Python.

# Research Applications

ApiLinker is particularly valuable for research applications where data must be collected from multiple sources with different APIs. Common research use cases include:

1. Aggregating data from multiple domain-specific repositories into a standardized format [@Wilkinson2016]
2. Creating reproducible data pipelines by explicitly documenting API integration parameters
3. Normalizing and transforming data between systems with incompatible schemas
4. Scheduling periodic data collection for longitudinal studies
5. Building custom dashboards that combine data from multiple sources

By providing a standardized approach to API integration, ApiLinker helps ensure that research data pipelines are maintainable, reproducible, and adaptable to changing API specifications.

# Conclusion

ApiLinker fills a gap in the open-source ecosystem by providing a flexible, configuration-driven approach to REST API integration. By abstracting common integration patterns into a declarative model, it reduces development time, improves code maintainability, and enables users to focus on their specific use cases rather than the mechanics of API communication.
