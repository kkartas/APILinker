# Summary

Modern software systems frequently rely on data exchange between specialized services, each with their own REST APIs. While individual API clients are common, developers often need to build custom integration code to connect different services. ApiLinker addresses this challenge by providing a universal bridge between any two REST APIs, enabling data mapping, transformation, and scheduled synchronization with minimal configuration. This open-source Python package simplifies the creation of reliable API integrations for both one-time data migrations and ongoing synchronization workflows.

# Statement of Need

The growth of microservices and SaaS products has created an ecosystem of specialized APIs that need to communicate with each other [@Fowler2014]. Currently, developers must choose between expensive commercial integration platforms, limited point-to-point connectors, or building custom integration code. Each approach has significant drawbacks in terms of cost, maintenance burden, flexibility, or development time.

Researchers and data scientists face similar challenges when collecting data from multiple REST APIs for analysis, often writing repetitive code for authentication, pagination, and data normalization [@Verborgh2013]. These integration challenges exist across domains including bioinformatics [@Ison2013], climate science [@Vitolo2015], and social media analytics [@Lomborg2014], where connecting disparate APIs is essential for comprehensive data collection.

ApiLinker addresses these needs by providing:

1. A configuration-driven approach that eliminates repetitive boilerplate code
2. Flexible field mapping with support for nested structures and data transformations
3. Authentication options (API Key, Bearer, Basic, OAuth2 flows) and optional secure credential storage
4. Enterprise-grade error handling with circuit breakers and dead letter queues
5. Built-in pagination handling, retry logic, and robust error management
6. Scheduling capabilities for recurring data synchronization
7. An extensible plugin architecture for custom connectors and transformations

By reducing integration complexity to a declarative configuration, ApiLinker enables developers, researchers and data scientists to focus on their domain-specific problems rather than the mechanics of API integration.

# Core Features

ApiLinker is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns into logical components:

## Security Features

APILinker provides security capabilities for handling sensitive data:

- **Secure Credential Storage**: Optional encrypted storage for API credentials
- **OAuth Support**: Implementation of modern OAuth flows including PKCE (for mobile/SPA) and Device Flow (for IoT/CLI)
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions for multi-user environments

## API Connectors

The connector module handles communication with REST APIs, supporting various HTTP methods, customizable endpoints, and automatic pagination. Each endpoint is configured with its path, method, headers, and optional parameters.

```python
connector = ApiConnector(
    connector_type="rest",
    base_url="https://api.example.com/v1",
    auth_config=auth_config,
    endpoints={
        "list_users": {
            "path": "/users",
            "method": "GET",
            "pagination": {"data_path": "data", "next_page_path": "meta.next"}
        }
    }
)
```

## Field Mapping

The mapper module translates data structures between source and target formats using a flexible mapping system. It supports nested field paths, conditional mappings, and data transformations.

```python
mapper.add_mapping(
    source="list_users",
    target="create_user",
    fields=[
        {"source": "id", "target": "external_id"},
        {"source": "profile.name", "target": "full_name", "transform": "strip"}
    ]
)
```

## Authentication

Multiple authentication methods are supported, with secure environment variable handling:

```yaml
auth:
  type: oauth2_client_credentials
  client_id: ${CLIENT_ID}
  client_secret: ${CLIENT_SECRET}
  token_url: https://auth.example.com/token
  scope: read write
```

## Scheduling

The scheduler component enables recurring synchronizations with interval or cron-based timing:

```python
scheduler.add_schedule(type="cron", expression="0 */6 * * *")  # Every 6 hours
scheduler.start(sync_function)
```

# Implementation and Architecture

ApiLinker is implemented in Python (3.8+) with minimal dependencies. The architecture follows object-oriented design principles with clear separation of concerns:

- `ApiConnector`: Handles HTTP communication, retries, and pagination
- `FieldMapper`: Manages data transformation between source and target formats
- `AuthManager`: Configures and refreshes authentication credentials
- `Scheduler`: Handles timing for recurring synchronization tasks
- `PluginManager`: Loads custom extensions for specialized use cases

The package is designed for both programmatic use as a library and as a command-line tool. Configuration can be defined in YAML/JSON or constructed programmatically in Python.

# Research Applications

ApiLinker addresses common challenges in research computing where data must be collected from multiple sources with different APIs. The software's design principles directly support reproducible research workflows:

1. **Reproducible Data Pipelines**: Configuration-driven approach ensures that API integration workflows can be versioned, shared, and exactly reproduced. Unlike custom scripts that often contain hardcoded parameters, ApiLinker's YAML configurations provide a declarative specification that can be archived alongside research data [@Wilkinson2016].

2. **Reduced Development Overhead**: By abstracting common API patterns (authentication, pagination, error handling), researchers can focus on domain-specific analysis rather than infrastructure code. The declarative configuration eliminates much of the boilerplate code typically required for API integrations.

3. **Error Resilience**: Built-in retry mechanisms, circuit breakers, and dead letter queues provide robust handling of transient API failures that commonly occur in long-running data collection workflows.

4. **Scheduling and Automation**: Native support for interval and cron-based scheduling enables automated data collection without external dependencies, critical for longitudinal studies and real-time monitoring applications.

5. **Cross-Domain Flexibility**: The plugin architecture and transformer system support diverse data formats and API patterns commonly encountered in interdisciplinary research, from bioinformatics repositories to climate monitoring networks.

The standardized approach to API integration helps ensure that research data pipelines remain maintainable and adaptable as API specifications evolve over time.

# Comparison with Existing Tools

ApiLinker occupies a unique position in the API integration ecosystem, balancing simplicity with research-specific requirements:
